		h2.ui.header The game in a paragraph
		p After 7 players are seated at a game table, the 10 roles chosen to be in this game by the game's creator are shuffled, distributed to the players, and are looked at once.  The remaining 3 role cards go into the center.  This is a game of teams - most roles are on the village team, but a few may be on the werewolf team. Then the night phase begins - players "wake up" and interact with other players in certain ways which can be read about below, notably, the werewolf team players know who the other werewolves are in secret.  After night phases are complete, the day phase begins, at the end of which every player must select another player for elimination.  The player(s) with the most votes then reveals his or her card - if a werewolf is eliminated, everyone on the village team wins.  Otherwise, the werewolves win.  If no one has more than a single vote (everyone votes in a circle), everyone on the village team wins if the center contains all of the werewolf cards.
